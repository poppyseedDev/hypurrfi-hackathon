# HypurrFi Stable Yield Vault

**One-Click Leveraged Stablecoin Yield Loops on HyperEVM**

A smart contract vault system that automates leveraged lending loops on HypurrFi, providing users with enhanced stablecoin yields through recursive supply/borrow strategies with automated risk management.

## 🎯 Overview

The Stable Yield Vault allows users to deposit stablecoins (USDC) and automatically execute a leveraged lending loop strategy:

1. **Deposit** → User deposits USDC
2. **Supply** → Vault supplies USDC to HypurrFi as collateral
3. **Borrow** → Vault borrows USDXL against the collateral (60% LTV)
4. **Re-supply** → Borrowed USDXL is supplied back as additional collateral
5. **Loop** → Steps 3-4 repeat up to 4 times for ~3-4x leverage
6. **Earn** → Compounding yield from both USDC and USDXL supply positions
7. **Auto-Rebalance** → Vault maintains healthy risk parameters automatically

### Key Features

- ✅ **One-Click Deposits**: Simple interface for complex multi-step strategies
- ✅ **Automated Leverage Loops**: Recursive supply/borrow execution in single transaction
- ✅ **Health Factor Monitoring**: Real-time tracking with auto-rebalance triggers
- ✅ **Risk Management**: Conservative parameters (HF target: 1.3, min: 1.15)
- ✅ **ERC-4626 Style**: Standard vault interface with share-based accounting
- ✅ **Emergency Controls**: Owner-controlled deleveraging and pause mechanisms
- ✅ **Full UI**: Next.js frontend with wallet connection and position monitoring

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contracts

```
packages/hardhat/
├── contracts/
│   └── StableYieldVault.sol      # Main vault contract (all-in-one)
├── interfaces/
│   ├── IPool.sol                  # HypurrFi Pool interface (Aave V3)
│   └── IERC20.sol                 # Standard ERC20 interface
├── scripts/
│   └── deploy.ts                  # Deployment script for HyperEVM
└── test/
    └── StableYieldVault.test.ts   # Comprehensive test suite
```

#### StableYieldVault.sol

The main vault contract implements:

- **Deposit/Withdraw**: ERC-4626 style share-based deposits and withdrawals
- **Loop Execution** (`_executeLoop`): Automated recursive supply → borrow → re-supply
- **Rebalancing** (`rebalance`): Maintains health factor within target range
- **Deleveraging** (`_deleverToTarget`): Reduces risk when HF drops below 1.15
- **Emergency Functions**: Owner-controlled pause and full position unwinding

Key Parameters:
- Target Health Factor: 1.3 (130% collateralization)
- Min Health Factor: 1.15 (rebalance trigger)
- Max Health Factor: 1.5 (under-leverage trigger)
- Target LTV: 60% (6000 basis points)
- Max Loop Iterations: 4

## 📦 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- HyperEVM network configured in wallet

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all workspace dependencies
pnpm install

# Or install individually
cd packages/hardhat && pnpm install
cd packages/nextjs && pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

#### Hardhat (.env in packages/hardhat/)

```bash
cp packages/hardhat/.env.example packages/hardhat/.env
```

Edit `.env`:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x
HYPEREVM_RPC_URL=https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/evm
```

#### Next.js (.env.local in packages/nextjs/)

```bash
# Create .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x... # Update after deployment
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id # From cloud.walletconnect.com
```

### 3. Add HyperEVM to MetaMask

**Network Details:**
- Network Name: HyperEVM
- RPC URL: `https://rpc.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/evm`
- Chain ID: `998`
- Currency Symbol: HYPE
- Block Explorer: `https://testnet.purrsec.com/`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy Smart Contracts

```bash
cd packages/hardhat

# Compile contracts
pnpm compile

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Deploy to HyperEVM mainnet
pnpm deploy:mainnet

# Or deploy to testnet (if available)
pnpm deploy:testnet
```

After deployment, copy the vault address and update:
- `packages/nextjs/lib/contracts.ts` → `VAULT_ADDRESS`
- `packages/nextjs/.env.local` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAULT_ADDRESS`

### Run Frontend

```bash
cd packages/nextjs

# Development mode
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Access at: `http://localhost:3000`

## 💰 Usage Guide

### For Users

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - Click "Connect Wallet" in the UI
   - Select your Web3 wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
   - Ensure you're on HyperEVM network

2. **Deposit USDC**
   - Navigate to deposit tab
   - Enter USDC amount
   - Approve USDC spending (first time only)
   - Click "Deposit" and confirm transaction
   - Vault shares will be minted to your address

3. **Monitor Position**
   - Go to Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
   - View health factor, leverage, LTV
   - Check your share balance and ownership %

4. **Rebalance (if needed)**
   - If health factor goes below 1.15 or above 1.5
   - Click "Rebalance" on dashboard
   - Vault will adjust leverage to target

5. **Withdraw**
   - Go to withdraw tab
   - Enter shares to burn
   - Click "Withdraw"
   - Vault unwinds position proportionally
   - USDC returned to your wallet

### For Developers

#### Interact with Contracts

```typescript
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const vault = new ethers.Contract(VAULT_ADDRESS, VAULT_ABI, signer);

// Deposit 100 USDC
await usdc.approve(VAULT_ADDRESS, ethers.parseUnits("100", 6));
await vault.deposit(ethers.parseUnits("100", 6));

// Get position details
const [collateral, debt, healthFactor] = await vault.getPositionDetails();

// Withdraw all shares
const shares = await vault.balanceOf(userAddress);
await vault.withdraw(shares);
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Risk Management

- **Conservative LTV**: 60% target provides safety margin against liquidation
- **Health Factor Monitoring**: Continuous tracking with auto-rebalance
- **Stablecoin Focus**: Minimizes volatility risk
- **Whitelisted Protocols**: Only interacts with HypurrFi contracts
- **Pause Mechanism**: Owner can halt deposits in emergency

### Liquidation Risk

- Liquidation occurs when Health Factor < 1.0
- Liquidation penalty: 8% of collateral
- Vault maintains HF ≥ 1.15 through rebalancing
- Users should monitor health factor regularly

### Smart Contract Risks

- **Unaudited Code**: This is a hackathon project - use with caution
- **Oracle Dependency**: Relies on HypurrFi/Hyperliquid price feeds
- **Interest Rate Risk**: Variable borrow rates may increase costs
- **USDXL Depeg Risk**: Vault assumes USDXL maintains $1 peg

### Best Practices

1. Start with small test deposits
2. Monitor health factor regularly
3. Withdraw if market conditions change
4. Understand liquidation risks
5. Never deposit more than you can afford to lose

## 📊 Technical Specifications

### HypurrFi Integration

**Contract Addresses (HyperEVM Mainnet):**
- HypurrFi Pool: `0xceCcE0EB9DD2Ef7996e01e25DD70e461F918A14b`
- USDC: `0xb88339CB7199b77E23DB6E890353E22632Ba630f`
- USDXL: `0xca79db4b49f608ef54a5cb813fbed3a6387bc645`
- USDT0: `0xb8ce59fc3717ada4c02eadf9682a9e934f625ebb` (alternative)

**Key Functions Used:**
- `supply(asset, amount, onBehalfOf, referralCode)` - Deposit collateral
- `borrow(asset, amount, interestRateMode, referralCode, onBehalfOf)` - Take loans
- `repay(asset, amount, rateMode, onBehalfOf)` - Repay debt
- `withdraw(asset, amount, to)` - Remove collateral
- `getUserAccountData(user)` - Get position metrics

### Loop Mechanics

**Example: 100 USDC Deposit with 60% LTV**

```
Iteration 0: Supply 100 USDC
Iteration 1: Borrow 60 USDXL → Supply 60 USDXL
Iteration 2: Borrow 36 USDXL → Supply 36 USDXL
Iteration 3: Borrow 21.6 USDXL → Supply 21.6 USDXL
Iteration 4: Borrow 12.96 USDXL → Supply 12.96 USDXL

Total Supplied: ~230.56 (2.3x leverage)
Total Debt: ~130.56 USDXL
Net Position: ~100 USDC value
Health Factor: ~1.3
```

### Gas Optimization

- Single transaction for full loop execution
- Batch operations where possible
- Infinite approvals reduce subsequent gas costs
- Optimized loop iteration count

## 📝 Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions

1. USDXL maintains peg close to $1.00
2. HypurrFi Pool remains liquid for deposits/withdrawals
3. Oracle price feeds remain accurate and available
4. Interest rates remain economically viable

### Current Limitations

4. **Basic Testing**: Limited fork testing due to testnet availability
5. **No Audit**: Hackathon code - not production-ready

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multi-asset support (USDT0, DAI, etc.)
- [ ] Automated keeper bot for rebalancing
- [ ] HYPE rewards claiming and auto-compounding
- [ ] Advanced strategies (delta-neutral, market-neutral)
